/*
225. Implement Stack using Queues
Easy

 Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

    push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
    pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
    top() -- Get the top element.
    empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.

Notes:

    You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
    Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
    You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
